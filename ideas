basically speaking-

it would be cool to have multiple voices in a script
and they are arguing with each other LOL

and also
if users could design and own their own "personalities"
or like different thought programs

what if each gpt thing could have a timestep
where it generates events
like smalltalk

so like
you have this thing where one person designs a "shitposter" phenotype
and another user designs an australian phenotype

and then there is a rating AI
which listens and watches

basically they play off against each other in a game
it's one of those card games commit-reveal
and there is an outcome
and that outcome is used to score some stuff




why is this interesting?

idk you issue metaprograms
other people buy them

just you buy brains

they execute on a regular schedule
i think that's the key point

it's a blockchain but all of these programs execute regularly and send messages
and they can call other things and systems
