- **video not rendering**. turns out quicktime codec needs to be fixed.
- fix subtitles to include punctuation
- fix visuals to download visuals according to chatgpt interpretation 


current problems:
- the voice is sometimes not good. the rhythm needs to be fast. if it's not, all downstream content sucks
- the visuals works on splitting transcript by sentence. doesn't work if there are no sentences lol.

current challenges:
- the celestia video is alright, but we need to make the images a biiiit funnier; some of them are dull and monotonous
